# AKingdomsTale

Welcome to "A Kingdom's Tale" - my first attempt at making a small game using Unity/C#. This was my first year end-of-term university project, so it's not unlikely that you'll encounter some bugs here and there. Maybe one day I'll actually find the source code lost somewhere on my drive and add it to this repo.

A playable version of the game is available for downloading [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/CjSF-DkLfVhnSA) on Yandex.Disk. To play the game, simply extract folder from the rar file, navigate inside the folder and launch the TowerDefense.exe file inside it. From there on, adjust the settings to your liking and play!
